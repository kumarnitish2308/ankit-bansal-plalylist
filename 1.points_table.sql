-- Problem statement 
-- Create a points table which contains team_name, matches_played, matches_won, matches_lost

--Solution 1
with matches_played as(
select team, count(*) as matches_played from (
select team_1 as team from icc_world_cup
union all

group by team),

select team, matches_played, coalesce(matches_won,0) as matches_won, coalesce(matches_played - matches_won,0) as matches_lost
from matches_played a
left join matches_won b on b.winner = a.team

--Solution 2
select team, count(*) as matches_played, sum(win_flag) as matches_won, count(*) - sum(win_flag) as matches_lost
