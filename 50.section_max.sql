/* 
We have a table which stores data of multiple sections.
Every section has 3 numbers. We have to find the top 4 numbers from any 2 sections(2 numbers each) 
whose addition should be maximum.
So, in this case we will choose section b where we have 19(10+9) then we need to choose either C or D
because both has the sum of 18 but in D we have 10 which is big from 9. So we will give priority to D.
