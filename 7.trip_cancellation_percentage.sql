/*
Write a sql query to find the cancellation rate of request with unbanned users
(both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03"
Round cancellation rate to 2 decimal points.

The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of cancelled (by client or driver)
requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.
