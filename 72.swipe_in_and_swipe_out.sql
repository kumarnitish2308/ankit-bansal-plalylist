/*
we have a swipe table which keeps track of employees login and logout time.
Find out the time spent by the employee in office on any particular day(office hours = last logout time - first login time)
Find out how productive he was at office at any particular day(He might have done many swipe-in and swipe-out in a day but what is the actual time spent by him in the office)
