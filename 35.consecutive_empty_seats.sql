/*There are 3 rows in a movie hall each with 10 seats in each row
Write a SQL query to find 4 consecutive empty seats in any row*/

with grp as(
select seat, occupancy, left(seat,1) as seat_row, cast(substring(seat,2,2) as unsigned) as seat_no,
cast(substring(seat,2,2) as unsigned)- row_number() over(partition by left(seat,1) order by cast(substring(seat,2,2) as unsigned)) as grp
from movie
where occupancy = 0),

final as(
select grp,seat_row  from grp
group by grp,seat_row
having count(*) >= 4)

select * from(
select seat, occupancy,b.grp from grp a
left join final b on b.grp = a.grp and a.seat_row = b.seat_row) a
where grp is not null
